# Django
The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.

## What is Django?
> Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern.

> Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.

## How popular is Django?

A better question is whether Django is "popular enough" to avoid the problems of unpopular platforms. Is it continuing to evolve? Can you get help if you need it?
Based on the number of high profile sites that use Django, the number of people contributing to the codebase, and the number of people providing both free and paid-for support, then yes, Django is a popular framework!

## Brief Overview
In a traditional data-driven website, a web application waits for HTTP requests from the web browser (or other clients). When a request is received the application works out what is needed based on the URL and possibly information in POST data or GET data. Depending on what is required it may then read or write information from a database or perform other tasks required to satisfy the request. The application will then return a response to the web browser, often dynamically creating an HTML page for the browser to display by inserting the retrieved data into placeholders in an HTML template.

Django web applications typically group the code that handles each of these steps into separate files.
